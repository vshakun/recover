# CS50-PSet-4-Recover

This is my code of the program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image, for Harvard's CS50 problems set 4.

## Specifications:

### Implement a program called recover that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.

1. Program should accept exactly one command-line argument, the name of a forensic image from which to recover JPEGs.

2. If program is not executed with exactly one command-line argument, it should remind the user of correct usage, and main should return 1.

3. If the forensic image cannot be opened for reading, program should inform the user as much, and main should return 1.

4. Program, if it uses malloc, must not leak any memory.
